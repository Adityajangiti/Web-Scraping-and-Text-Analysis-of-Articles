# Web-Scraping-and-Text-Analysis-of-Articles
This project involves analyzing a set of articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques in Python. The input data consists of a list of URLs for articles in the financial and technology sectors. The program downloads and parses each article, then performs NLP analysis to extract metrics such as sentiment scores, readability metrics, and part-of-speech (POS) tags. The results are then saved to an output Excel file for further analysis and reporting. The project can be used to gain insights into the language and content of news articles in a particular domain, as well as to compare and contrast articles based on their NLP features.
